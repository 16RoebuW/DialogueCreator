# Godot 4.2 dialogue tree editor

This is a program, made in Godot, that allows the user to create a graph of dialogue lines and choices using a GUI. It outputs a JSON file to store this data so that it can be used in dialogue systems.

## Features

- Offer dialogue options based on a condition
- Call functions when dialogue is used
- Looping pathways
- Multi-character conversations
- Set up characters with data

 ## Limitations

- Loading JSON files does not lay nodes out nicely
- Godot's UI graph is implemented strangly and subject to change soon (or may have already)
